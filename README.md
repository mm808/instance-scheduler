# Instance Scheduler Terraform      
This project implements the AWS instance scheduler tool stacks using a Terraform wrapper. It configures the main stack in a 'services' account and configures a secondary stack that adds a custom schedule and period in the DynamoDB table as a demonstration of how we can programmatically create custom schedules along side the default configuration.
